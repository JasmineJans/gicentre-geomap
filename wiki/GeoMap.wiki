=GeoMap=

GeoMap makes drawing geographic maps in Processing easy.

==Install==

To install GeoMap, download the most recent version from the Downloads page and follow the [http://wiki.processing.org/w/How_to_Install_a_Contributed_Library Manual Install] instructions on the Processing wiki.

==Use==

===Constructor methods===

GeoMap has two constructor methods.

<code language="processing">GeoMap(xOrigin, yOrigin, mapWidth, mapHeight, parent)</code>

The first constructor method creates a map with the given bounds. It has five parameters:

 # {{{xOrigin}}} is the position of the map from the left of the sketch.
 # {{{yOrigin}}} is the position of the map from the top of the sketch.
 # {{{mapWidth}}} is the width of the map.
 # {{{mapHeight}}} is the height of the map.
 # {{{parent}}} is the parent sketch. In most cases, simply use {{{this}}} to refer to the current Processing sketch.

----
<code language="processing">GeoMap(PApplet parent)</code>

The second constructor method creates a map with the default bounds. It has one parameter:

 # {{{parent}}} is the parent sketch. In most cases, simply use {{{this}}} to refer to the current Processing sketch.

===Draw methods===

GeoMap has three draw methods.

<code language="processing">geoMap.draw()</code>

The first draw method draws the map in the parent sketch.

----
<code language="processing">geoMap.draw(id)</code>

The second draw method draws the feature that matches the given id. It has one parameter:

 # {{{id}}} is the id that identifies the feature to draw. It should be an {{{int}}}.

----
<code language="processing">geoMap.draw(attribute, column)</code>

The third draw method draws the features that match the given attribute in the given column in the map's attribute table. It has two parameters:

 # {{{attribute}}} is the attribute that identifies the features to draw. It should be a {{{String}}}.
 # {{{column}}} is the column in the attribute table. It should be an {{{int}}}. Note that the first column in the attribute table is {{{0}}}, the second is {{{1}}}, the third is {{{2}}} and so on.
