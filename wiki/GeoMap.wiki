===Constructor methods===

GeoMap has two constructor methods.

<code language="processing">GeoMap(xOrigin, yOrigin, mapWidth, mapHeight, parent)</code>

The first constructor method creates a map with the given bounds. It has five parameters:

 # {{{xOrigin}}} is the position of the map from the left of the sketch.
 # {{{yOrigin}}} is the position of the map from the top of the sketch.
 # {{{mapWidth}}} is the width of the map.
 # {{{mapHeight}}} is the height of the map.
 # {{{parent}}} is the parent sketch. In most cases, simply use {{{this}}} to refer to the current Processing sketch.

----
<code language="processing">GeoMap(PApplet parent)</code>

The second constructor method creates a map with the default bounds. It has one parameter:

 # {{{parent}}} is the parent sketch. In most cases, simply use {{{this}}} to refer to the current Processing sketch.
